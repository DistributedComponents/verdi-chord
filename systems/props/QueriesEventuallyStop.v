Theorem queries_eventually_stop :

Proof.
(*
This is tricky.

  If you have an open request, you're in the middle of some operation.
  Operations (stabilization, rectifying, etc) undertaken by joined nodes complete
  in finitely many request-response pairs.
  A request eventually gets a response if there are no circular waits...

DIFFICULTY: Ryan
USED: In phase one for the proof of eventual stabilization.
