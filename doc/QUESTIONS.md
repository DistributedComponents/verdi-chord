* reuse definitions from LabeledNet.v in Verdi?

* move things to core! move other things to lib? (what does Ryan think)

* handler lemmas, like SpecLemmas in Verdi, very big lemmas right now, decompose into smaller lemmas, don't get all cases everytime!

* do we want intermediate reachability? weaker stuff?

* reorganize ChordLabeled a bit, move to different dir, factor out Chord-specific stuff

* ChordPromises: which ones are hard, which ones are impossible, which ones are easy?

* client handling, client payload, client non-state

* ask Ryan for more things to move!

* naming conventions?

* ask Ryan for difficulty of PhaseTwo admits

* phase 3! we need at least some lemmas+admits

* invariants in separate files?!?

* state of the shim, client?!?

* how do we start shim/client?
